Write a code to print out a multiplication table (where each number is the result of multiplying the first number of its row by the number at the top of its column). Fill in the blanks so that calling multiplication_table(1, 3) will print out:
1 2 3
2 4 6
3 6 9

-- Code starts here --
def multiplication_table(start, stop):
	for x in range(1,stop+1):
		for y in range(1,stop+1):
			print(str(x*y), end=" ")
		print()

multiplication_table(1, 3)
